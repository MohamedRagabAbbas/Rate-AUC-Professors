In 2023 she was selected by the American Psychological Association to be featured in the documentary filmRepresentation Matters, highlighting 30 diverse influential psychologists. Amer has been a keynote speaker at professional conferences in many countries, including US, Canada, UK, Malta, and Italy.Amer received her PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Toledo, Ohio, in 2005. She completed her pre-doctoral internship at the Connecticut Mental Health Center and The Consultation Center at the Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine. In 2006, she was awarded the annual American Psychological Association\u2019s Award for Distinguished Graduate Student in Professional Psychology \\\"for her outstanding and innovative leadership in addressing the mental health needs of Muslim and Arab Americans\\\".

Amer is a licensed psychologist in the state of Connecticut.\\', \\'Research Interest\\': \\\"Amer\u2019s primary research and policy interests revolve around racial/ethnic and religious disparities in behavioral health. Disparities include poorer mental health status, reduced service access, poorer quality of care, and poorer service outcomes for minority groups. She is interested in how immigration experiences, acculturation stressors, discrimination/ stigma, and minority status contribute to these disparities and the roles of culturally competent services and community-based programming in eliminating the inequalities. Within this framework, she has specializations in the Muslim American and Arab American populations, particularly in the hostile post-9/11 socio-political context. To enhance scholarship and community practice focused on these populations, she has worked on psychometrically sound instruments for use in minority research and analysis of applications of ethical codes of practice.Amer is internationally recognized as a trailblazer in developing specializations related to Muslim and Arab minorities. In 2000 she launched the onlineMuslim Mental Health Networkthat was the catalyst and organizing platform for formalizing the interdisciplinary field known asMuslim mental health. Around that time, she designed some of the first cultural competence workshops and accredited training conferences for practitioners serving Muslim clients that were administered in the US and UK. She was on the founding board and served as editor-in-chief of theJournal of Muslim Mental Health. She also served as a Steward Group Member of the National Network to Eliminate Disparities at the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and participated in other SAMHSA and US Department of Health and Human Services initiatives related to Arab, Muslim, and ethnic/racial minority communities. Amer also spent more than a decade collaborating with colleagues to envision and work towards a professional association representing Arab/MENA psychologists.

Since 1982, Casaman\u00e7ais separatists have been trying to secede from Senegal. Deets studies the ways in which separatist elites have tried to counter-map a Casaman\u00e7ais identity against Senegal through particular social spaces: the river, the rice field, the school, the forest and the stadium. As separatists sought to transform these spaces into places for a putative Casaman\u00e7ais nation, ordinary Casaman\u00e7ais contested, corroborated, or ignored separatist assertions, revealing a second layer of counter-mapping based on local values and interests. Deets shows why the history of this socio-cultural mapping and counter-mapping has been so important to the Casamance conflict.\\xa0Deets also serves as Francophone Book Review Editor forThe Journal of West African History.\\xa0When not studying African history,\\xa0Deets likes to root for the Kansas City Chiefs/Royals/Sporting KC and Manchester United.\\', \\'Research Interest\\': \\'African NationalismAfrican Spatial HistoryWest Africa and the Atlantic WorldWar and Conflict in Africa\\'}"

He earned his BSc in Entomology and Pesticide Chemistry from the Faculty of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, Alexandria University. It was there that he fell in love with neuroscience and toxicology. Returning to the USA, he started a journey of discovery in Cornell University, after which he worked in generic pharmaceuticals and organic solvents industries for trhee years. He went on to earn his MSc, from the University of Guelph, Canada, and PhD in Biomedical and Veterinary Medical Sciences from Virginia Tech. El-Fawal was a Research Assistant Professor at New York University Medical Center\u2019s Institute of Environmental Medicine. Recruited by Mercy College, a Liberal Arts institution, he developed, and taught, Natural and Biomedical Sciences curricula for undergraduate Biology, Health Sciences and graduate Health Professional Programs in Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech Pathology, Physician Assistant Studies, Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, and Advanced Nurse Practitioner Programs. He joined Mercy College as Associate Chair, then Chair\\xa0of the Division of Natural Sciences and Veterinary Technology, and was Director of the Environmental Health and Safety program, as well as developing courses in Islamic History and Arabic. Prior to joining the American University in Cairo (AUC) in 2016, he was professor and founding dean of the School of Health Sciences with joint appointment as Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences\\xa0at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, where he developed undergraduate and graduate programs in Medical Diagnostics, Biotechnology, Nanomedicine, and Health Outcomes Research and Informatics.

His research is in the area of Environmental Health, with a particular focus on developing diagnostic tests of neurodegeneration, environmental cardiopulmonary diseases, and nanosafety. However, his mission is to break down barriers that impede meaningful progress and solutions for the human condition. Believing that one should not just talk the talk, but must walk the walk, El-Fawal has been instrumental in establishing the interdisciplinary Institute of Global Health and Human Ecology (I-GHHE), with graduate offerings in Global Public Health and Environmental Sustainability. Consistent with this is I-GHHE\u2019s Center for Applied Research on the Environment and Sustainability (CARES).As a relaxation from his administrative responsibilities, El-Fawal seeks opportunities to interact with students through teaching and research. El-Fawal has trained nearly 80 undergraduate, Masters, Doctorate and Post-doctorate fellows in the course of his career.Read More\\', \\'Research Interest\\': \\\"Research work in El-Fawal\\'s\\xa0Laboratory revolves around applying innovative technology to address health and environmental challenges. However, he believes in a holistic approach that recognizes the interplay with the ethical, social and policy determinants of health and environmental sustainability. In keeping with this, his laboratory works with engineers, biologists, chemists, physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals, as well as social and behavioral scientists, and regulatory professionals. El-Fawal believes that sustainable solutions to challenges can only be addressed through a team-effort that inculcates social responsibility, beyond the laboratory, classroom, or the narrow definition of community. The diversity of El-Fawal\u2019s interests is further exemplified by the courses he has taught and teaches.\\\"}"

The first volume seeks to provide a definitive interpretation of the manner in which Hume\u2019s skepticism and naturalism influenced Kant in both his pre-critical and critical periods. The volume discusses how Kant first appropriated such skepticism within the 1760s, only to then react against such positions within the 1770s and beyond. In so doing, it strives to provide a comprehensive and systematic account of the genesis of Kantian transcendental philosophy, as well as a rigorous philosophical assessment of Kant\u2019s claims to have undermined and usurped skepticism and naturalism within the theoretical and practical philosophy espoused throughout the 1780s. The second volume provides a detailed account of the reception of Kant\u2019s transcendental philosophy within the first twenty-five years following its appearance. It focuses on how Kant\u2019s attempts to silence the skeptic and naturalist were subjected to intense scrutiny by figures inspired by Hume (such as Jacobi, Maimon and Schulze-Aenesidemus) and how the attempts of the \u201cfriends\u201d of the critical philosophy (such as Reinhold and Fichte) to inoculate transcendental philosophy against any such skeptical objection eventually gave rise to the foundationalist projects characterizing German Idealism. In addition to a historical account of these developments, the volume provides a more systematic discussion of the legitimacy of the criticisms to which Kant\u2019s answers to the skeptic were subject, as well as an assessment of whether German Idealism marks either an advance upon Kantian transcendental philosophy or a retreat into uncritical dogmatic metaphysics.He is also the English translator of\\xa0Claus Dierksmeier,\\xa0Qualitative Freiheit: Selbstbestimmung in weltb\u00fcrgerlicher Verantwortung\\xa0(transcript Verlag, 2016).\\'}"

Besides her task for executing environmental design interventions in the MICHAP program, she worked closely with disenfranchised communities, local stakeholders and city officials to create resilient cities through environmentally conscious design strategies and policy recommendations.One of Hamdy\u2019s main areas of research interest focuses on developing the urban morphology of the macro and micro scale of cities from the lens of sustainability. Also, her research interest encompasses other issues that are crucial to delivering socio-spatial sustainability, such as climate change, green building, green infrastructure, landscape spatial patterns, placemaking, civic design, regional infrastructure development and urban design and planning. She relies mostly on her research on combining empirical and quantitative approaches to acutely examine the correlation between the built environment and humans\\' health and public well-being.\\\", \\'Research Interest\\': \\'Green Building and Human experienceSustainable and Resilient UrbanismTrajectories of Global UrbanismHistorical and Contemporary Urban Design and Planning Theories and PracticesClimate Change Impacts on the Macro and Micro Scale of CitiesUrban RevitalizationSocial and Spatial JusticePlacemaking and Civic Design\\'}"

A major claim of the book is that Hegel can be read hermeneutically as an aesthetic thinker whose approach to time, language, and imagination needs to be revisited. The poetry of Spenser, Wordsworth, and Shelley, as well as the novels of Proust, Jean Rhys, and Kazuo Ishiguro are explored based on this special method.Professor Melaney\u2019s current research commences with an examination of Kant\u2019s aesthetics and then considers how, in the aftermath of Kant, aesthetic questions acquired historical resonance. The question of history will be taken up as it emerges in opposition to historicism. The conclusion of the book will argue that the more recent approaches to aesthetics have social, cultural and political implications.Melaney has also published a short book of poems entitledBildungsroman.(Cairo:\\xa0Safsafa Publishing House, 2017).\\', \\'Research Interest\\': \\'Comparative LiteratureAesthetics from Kant to Ranci\u00e8rePossibilities of World LiteratureNew Readings of HegelPoetics and Literary History\\'}"

Moments of crisis reveal the limits of belonging within various conceptions of community, and crucially, the way in which group identities are both reproduced and transformed in these moments.\\xa0As such, investigating moments of crisis provides an opportunity to illuminate the often arbitrary or silent assumptions underlying discourses and practices of inclusion and exclusion, and allows for the development of alternatives forms of community, belonging, and being political.\\', \\'Education\\': \\'PhD.

After nine years of working in research and development projects in Egypt, she shifted interest to Sub-Saharan Africa, primarily East and southern Africa where she conducted research in Tanzania on questions related to land, labor and the making of histories. Her experiences in both North and sub-Saharan Africa were instrumental in defining one of my broader intellectual concerns, namely how the very category of Africa has been historically constructed as an object of knowledge and as a cultural-political entity subject to a long history of interventionist and extractive politics. This is intimately related to an overarching concern about knowledge and decolonization, where she asked how we produce knowledge, by whom, for what, when and where, and in what languages and forms.Sabea\\'s research in Tanzania focused on the meanings associated with the transition from socialism to free-market economy and polity, taking sisal plantations as a microcosm for broader transformations. One question she pursued related to how people construct their histories under diverse regimes of power colonial, post-colonial, capitalist and socialist, and how these pasts affect their present social worlds.The interface between anthropology, history and political economy continues to shape my current and future research. Imagining the political and the struggles for transformation; affective relations in experiencing and narrating revolutionary change; irregular migration and the unbound bodies of laboring subjects are three projects in which I am currently involved. Simultaneously, Sabea continued to examine knowledge production in the social sciences with a particular focus on ethnographic explorations of gender differences in science labs and classrooms; and alternative modalities of producing knowledge beyond the confines of the classroom and the University and conventional ethnographic methodologies.After six years of holding a joint appointment at the Department of Anthropology and the Carter G. Woodson Institute for African and African American Studies at the University of Virginia, she returned to AUC with a keen interest in continuing my research agenda and using it as a platform for teaching and service. In the SEA department, she offers a number of courses at the undergraduate level, including Introduction to Cultural Anthropology; Anthropologies of Africa; Fieldwork Methods; Contemporary Theory in Anthropology; Classic Social Theory; Anthropology and Travel Accounts; Public History and Archiving; Migrants and Transnationals.

Working at the nexus between economic and political anthropology, he addresses how value operates under regimes of both humanitarian protection and the exercise of military force. His work offers accounts of objects, ideas, texts, bodies, acts and beliefs that travel across space and time and in the process come to matter differently. His first book treats emergent economic subjectivities in Sudan and how humanitarian attention channels affect and builds life worlds around events of spectacular violence. The book aims to make sense of these phenomena by treating them as economies of attention, with all the implications of scarcity, redistribution, and transaction these carry in tow. Having conducted multisite fieldwork in Sudan, the forthcoming book places localized phenomena of fiercely contested value under the dual rubrics of aid and war in the context of other historical moments of humanitarian attention. Prior to coming to AUC, he worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Makerere Institute for Social Research. He holds a PhD\\xa0from Columbia University.

As a graduate student instructor, he taught at both UCSC and, prior to that, San Francisco State University, where he received his MA in philosophy.Rule\u2019s research and teaching are animated by interests in philosophical anthropology and the question of the meaning of human existence, especially as explored by thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. In his dissertation, he argued that common attitudes and discourse regarding the question of the meaning of human existence should be rekindled and refocused in order to overcome certain entrenched preconceptions about what is at stake with the question, treating it with its proper importance. He further argued that philosophical vocabularies like Heidegger\u2019s, which discuss existential meaning and meaninglessness in terms of \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018journeying (away from home),\u2019 stand to help philosophers think through underexplored dimensions of these phenomena, such as the ineluctably ethical nature of the question of meaning.Rule is a member of both the American Philosophical Association and the Heidegger Circle (based out of Depaul University).\\', \\'Research Interest\\': \\'AOS: 19th-20th Century Continental Philosophy (esp.
